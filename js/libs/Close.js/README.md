Close.js
========

With close.js, you can close an iOS web app right from javascript! Just use the closewebapp() function.

This is a little demo on how to use close.js :

Download the 'close.js' file and put it in the main directory of your server.

Use this html to include Close.js:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="close.js"></script>

Use the closewebapp() function to close the app :

    <button onClick="closewebapp()">Close this web app !</button>

That's it !

I made a little demo which can be tested here : http://bit.ly/18GPrZO

Thanks for using close.js
